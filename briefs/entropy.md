### 0. The Fool: The Accident

**Sound Signature:** Broadband white noise, granular "dust," and unpredictable transient spikes.

* **Acoustics:** Total lack of stereo centering. Sound should feel like it is happening *at* you rather than around you.
* **Systemic Logic:** **Stochastic Resonance.** A state of pure potential where no pattern has yet emerged. High-frequency jitters represent the "source code" glitches.

### I. The Magician: The Burden of Action

**Sound Signature:** The introduction of a rhythmic pulse (the Will). Layering of sawtooth oscillators that begin to sync.

* **Acoustics:** A sudden shift to a hard-panned, dual-mono structure. It sounds organized but aggressive.
* **Systemic Logic:** **Positive Feedback Loop.** Every "action" (new track layer) increases the gain of the entire system. The soundscape becomes dense and "heavy," mimicking the weight of the steering wheel.

### IX. The Hermit: The Specialized Knowledge

**Sound Signature:** Deep, resonant low-pass filtering. The high-end chaos of the Magician is cut away, leaving a singular, low-frequency drone (the Hum).

* **Acoustics:** High reverb/long decay times to simulate a vast, empty interior space. Sounds are distant, singular, and precise.
* **Systemic Logic:** **Information Isolation.** The system stops accepting external inputs. The "signal" is pure but narrow, representing a focus so tight it borders on a vacuum.

### XVIII. The Moon: The Dissolution of Truth

**Sound Signature:** Heavy use of frequency shifters, flangers, and pitch-drifting tape saturation. The "Hum" from the Hermit begins to waver and "hallucinate" harmonics.

* **Acoustics:** Blurred phase relationships. The listener should feel slightly dizzy as the center image drifts.
* **Systemic Logic:** **Recursive Error Propagation.** The system begins to process its own echoes as new data, leading to a breakdown in the distinction between the original signal and the artifact.

### XVI. The Tower: The Necessary Failure

**Sound Signature:** Digital clipping, bit-crushing to 1-bit, and sudden "blackouts" (hard silences). A catastrophic mechanical "clunk" followed by the sound of a system cooling down.

* **Acoustics:** Extreme dynamic range. Violent, percussive bursts that "shatter" the previous drones.
* **Systemic Logic:** **System Reset.** An intentional overload of the CPU/buffers to force a crash. The destruction of the "Magician’s" complex architecture.

### XX. Judgement: The Rebirth (The Witness)

**Sound Signature:** High-fidelity field recordings (wind, water, distant birds) overlaid with a single, unadorned sine wave.

* **Acoustics:** Wide, natural stereo field. Transparent and "airy."
* **Systemic Logic:** **Steady State.** The system no longer seeks to manipulate or grow; it simply passes the input through to the output without processing. The complexity is understood (the sine wave) but not imposed on the environment (the field recordings).
