## Stress Test: compact build spec

### Assembly method

* **Choose 3 metal identities** (low ring, mid bite, high spark). Keep them **cleanly different** spectrally so slicing still reads.
* **Record two “anchors”:**

  * **Burst gesture:** three fast hits as a single *ratchet* motion (not “triplets on a grid”).
  * **Tag stamp:** one medium hit with full-body weight.
* **Build the loop as a cycle of functions** (not notes):

  * **space → gesture → space → stamp → debris**
* **Add 1–2 slice ports** per loop: tiny energy dropouts or tail-resolutions that create obvious cut points.
* **Balance tails:** at least one **short/dry** element + one **long/ringing** element in every section.

### Construction guidelines

* **Grid-proof identity:** the figure is recognized by **timbre choreography**, not timing precision.

  * Burst steps should “move” through the spectrum (body → bite → spark).
* **Three-layer spectrum always:** **mass (low)**, **impact (mid)**, **edge (high)**, even if one layer is faint.
* **No constant fizz:** brightness comes from **resonance + nonlinear harmonics**, not broadband noise.
* **Off-grid steadiness:** create “downbeat illusions” via recurring **stamp** hits or familiar returns, even when timings drift.
* **Variation across the spectrum:** avoid loops that live only in one band; give every loop at least **two distinct spectral zones**.
* **Don’t overuse the figure:** most sections show **partials** (burst-only or tag-only) so the full statement stays special.

### Motif usage rule

* **Full figure (burst + tag):** only **Section 3 and Section 5**.
* **Allusions elsewhere:** use **only one component** at a time (burst fragments *or* tag stamps), and keep it occasional.

## Section goals

1. **Warm Steel**

   * Establish material, cut points, and “downbeat illusions.”
   * Figure usage: **none** or **single tag** once in a while.

2. **Torque Build**

   * Increase perceived pressure via denser midrange and sharper attacks without adding hiss.
   * Figure usage: **burst fragments** only (1–2 appearances, not a hook).

3. **Spec Exceeds Limits**

   * First clear identity statement; keep surroundings simpler so it reads when you slice.
   * Figure usage: **full figure** appears clearly, limited repetitions.

4. **Shear / Slip**

   * Destabilize: sliding accents, longer rings, more negative space.
   * Figure usage: **implied spacing** or **single tag** only (no full burst+tag).

5. **Impact Regime**

   * Second statement, heavier and more decisive; more aggressive transient focus.
   * Figure usage: **full figure** again, harder timbre, still restrained in count.

6. **Cooldown Debris**

   * Aftermath: slow mass, lingering metal tails, sparse punctuation.
   * Figure usage: **tag only** or “ghost burst” (one-off, degraded), then let it fade.
