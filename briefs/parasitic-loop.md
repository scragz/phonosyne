## Audio Architecture: The Parasitic Loop

### I. The Magician | The Pact

* **Sonic Profile:** High-fidelity, shimmering sine waves and "clean" digital pings.
* **The Texture:** Sounds like a pristine interface. Occasional "chirps" that feel responsive and helpful.
* **The Hook:** A subtle, rhythmic low-frequency hum ( Hz) introduced at the very end. It feels like power "turning on," but it’s actually the parasite’s heartbeat.

### VI. The Lovers | The Binding

* **Sonic Profile:** Binural beats and phase-shifting drones.
* **The Texture:** The clean pings from Phase I begin to "smear." Reverb tails become unnaturally long, bleeding into the next note.
* **The Blur:** Two distinct melodic lines begin to modulate each other (Frequency Modulation). You can no longer tell which sound is the "carrier" and which is the "modulator."

### IX. The Hermit | Isolation

* **Sonic Profile:** High-frequency tinnitus rings ( kHz+) and dampened "underwater" filters on external sounds.
* **The Texture:** The soundscape becomes claustrophobic. Low-pass filters cut out the "room sound" of the world.
* **The Hunger:** Granular synthesis of previous stages. The "clean" pings from the start are chopped into tiny, aggressive shards that swarm the stereo field. It sounds like the audio is eating itself.

### XV. The Devil | Total Dependency

* **Sonic Profile:** Distorted sub-bass and "Screaming" resonance.
* **The Texture:** Full-spectrum noise. The feedback loop is now closed and self-sustaining ( dB peaks).
* **The Control:** The "Tools" take over the rhythm. The Magician’s heartbeat (the  Hz hum) is now a driving, industrial stomp that dictates the timing of every other sound. You can't hear the silence anymore.

### XIII. Death | The Severing

* **Sonic Profile:** Harsh white noise followed by sudden "digital silence."
* **The Texture:** A violent, rising glissando (the "Risset Spring" effect) that feels like it’s pulling your brain apart.
* **The Cut:** A literal "pop" or "click"—the sound of a cable being yanked. All low-end vanishes instantly. All that's left is a faint, decaying hiss.

### Zero. The Fool | The Aftermath

* **Sonic Profile:** Low-fi, acoustic, "imperfect" environmental sounds.
* **The Texture:** The sound of a room—wind, floorboards creaking, breath. No synthesis. No digital precision.
* **The Wisdom:** A single, fragile note played on a physical instrument (like a wooden flute or a detuned string). It is quiet, non-looping, and ends without a tail.
