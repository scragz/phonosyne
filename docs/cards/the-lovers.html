      <h1>The Lovers merge into corrupted unity</h1>
      <p>
        They came in fever and perfume, limbs entwined like serpents who had
        forgotten their origins. The air pulsed with glitchy heartbeats and
        moans transposed to fifths. Not fusion, but friction, sacred abrasion.
        Their shadows danced in forbidden geometry, and I knew this was not
        harmony, it was <em>conspiracy</em>. Love, raw and blasphemous, stripped
        of myth. Each kiss a command line. Each climax a reboot of the cosmos.
