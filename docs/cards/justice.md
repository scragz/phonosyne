# Justice balances echoes on a blade of wind

In the sanctum of steel and feather, the blade was raised, not to strike, but to listen. I heard her footfall as rhythm, her breath as metronome.

She taught me that the scales do not weigh right against wrong, but resonance against silence, consequence against decay. Her judgments ring like tuning forks in the soul.
