      <h1>The Empress distorts natural growth into bloom</h1>
      <p>
        She writhed from the earth like a crowned root, her thighs veiled in ivy
        and rot. From her lips spilled song, lush, sticky, fertile, with
        harmonies so ripe they bled. The forest answered in shrieks of cicadas
        and low murmurs of worm-song. She did not create beauty. She
        <em>overran</em> it. Love fermented into thorns, and orgasm bloomed as
        fungus on the skin of the world. I bowed before her, knowing no
        distinction between nourishment and devouring.
