# The Lovers merge into corrupted unity

They came in fever and perfume, limbs entwined like serpents who had forgotten their origins. The air pulsed with glitchy heartbeats and moans transposed to fifths. Not fusion, but friction, sacred abrasion. Their shadows danced in forbidden geometry, and I knew this was not harmony, it was _conspiracy_. Love, raw and blasphemous, stripped of myth. Each kiss a command line. Each climax a reboot of the cosmos.
