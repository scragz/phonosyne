# The Chariot drags ruin across soft earth

Clad in rust and neon, the charioteer emerged from the smoke, reins taut with prophecy. The wheels cut sigils into soil, syllables of forward motion. I heard engines wailing beneath horsehide, a sacred roar against inertia. Behind him: dust and disaster. Before him: order through obliteration. He was not control. He was _momentum embodied_. He drove because stopping was a heresy.
