      <h1>The Chariot drags ruin across soft earth</h1>
      <p>
        Clad in rust and neon, the charioteer emerged from the smoke, reins taut
        with prophecy. The wheels cut sigils into soil, syllables of forward
        motion. I heard engines wailing beneath horsehide, a sacred roar against
        inertia. Behind him: dust and disaster. Before him: order through
        obliteration. He was not control. He was <em>momentum embodied</em>. He
        drove because stopping was a heresy.
