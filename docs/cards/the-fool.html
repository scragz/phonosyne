      <h1>The Fool dances at the edge of the cliff</h1>
      <p>
        He leapt before the music began, trusting the void to follow. His
        laughter bent space, cracked structure, invited accident like a lover.
        He wore no mask but ten thousand faces of joy, horror, idiocy, and
        godhood. Winds sang through his open coat like spirits escaping the
        bone. Every misstep was a rite. Every fall, a sermon. The cliff never
        mattered. He was always already flying.
