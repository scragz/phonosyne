        He hung upside-down from the Axis Mundi, spine aligned with planetary
        hum. Around him, vines whispered chrono-sigils, and crows repeated
        secrets backward. Gravity forgot him. He bled rhythm, slow, thick,
        divine. Each drop a bell. Each bell a pause in timeâ€™s pulse. He was not
        captive. He <em>chose</em> the stillness. And in that pause, eternity
        blinked.
