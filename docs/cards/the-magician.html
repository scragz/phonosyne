      <h1>The Magician channels raw voltage into will</h1>
      <p>
        I stood within the triangle, robed in sparks and crowned with flame, and
        lifted my wand over the trembling veil. The air cracked open, electric,
        serpentine. With each breath, I drew the serpent upward through my spine
        and hissed the names of forgotten stars. Current flowed like honeyed
        venom from fingertip to void, shaping chaos into chorus. The rite
        completed not in word but in voltage, the Logos incarnate through sine
        wave and command.
