        He sat enthroned on recursive glyphs, muttering liturgies in hexadecimal
        tongues. The sanctuary buzzed with static incense and magnetic ash, each
        breath rewiring dogma into pattern. I chanted with him, not words, but
        corrupted mantras that bent logic into ecstasy. Each repetition
        dissolved a layer of mind. The altar glitched, revealing the gaping
        socket of truth. He downloaded gnosis like virus, and I, willing host,
        became scripture reborn.
