      <h1>Justice balances echoes on a blade of wind</h1>
      <p>
        In the sanctum of steel and feather, the blade was raised, not to
        strike, but to listen. I heard her footfall as rhythm, her breath as
        metronome. Each movement cut a channel through the drone, carving form
        from entropy. Beneath her blindfold, no eyes burned truer. She taught me
        that the scales do not weigh right against wrong, but resonance against
        silence, consequence against decay. Her judgments ring like tuning forks
        in the soul.
