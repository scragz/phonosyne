# The Empress distorts natural growth into bloom

She writhed from the earth like a crowned root, her thighs veiled in ivy and rot. From her lips spilled song, lush, sticky, fertile, with harmonies so ripe they bled. The forest answered in shrieks of cicadas and low murmurs of worm-song. She did not create beauty. She _overran_ it. Love fermented into thorns, and orgasm bloomed as fungus on the skin of the world. I bowed before her, knowing no distinction between nourishment and devouring.
