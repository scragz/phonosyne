      <h1>The Hermit isolates in a frozen echo</h1>
      <p>
        He walked into the snowfall, a lantern dangling from a horned staff of
        dead light. The wind made no sound, it <em>listened</em>. Beneath the
        frost-bitten canopy, his breath summoned tone from silence. The world
        retreated, each flake a data point in divine solitude. He did not seek
        truth, he <em>cultivated its absence</em>. His song was a whisper to the
        roots, and the roots remembered.
