      <h1>The High Priestess guards a temple of mist and root</h1>
      <p>
        Between the twin pillars of moss and nightshade, She sat cloaked in
        mycelial lace, her eyes two mirrors reflecting dreams unborn. Her voice,
        if voice it was, was a chorus of dewdrops falling on sacred bone. I
        beheld her through incense-thick shadow, where silence speaks louder
        than god. And there, beneath the temple floor, the earth exhaled secrets
        in modulated pulses. She did not answer questions. She <em>was</em> the
        question.
