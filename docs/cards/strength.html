      <h1>Strength compresses feral signals into form</h1>
      <p>
        In the circle of bone and purr, she tamed no beast. She
        <em>spoke with it</em>. Her whisper modulated sine into chant, fury into
        trance. Muscles clenched not in conquest, but containment, ritual
        boundaries where rage met rhythm. She kissed the jaw of the beast, lips
        wet with its growl. They sang together, a duet of wild precision. Her
        power was not in the binding, but in the agreement.
