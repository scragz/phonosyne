      <h1>Wheel of Fortune spins and determines futures</h1>
      <p>
        The wheel turned, no hands, no mechanism, only inevitability. A chorus
        of clinking bones and shuffled timelines struck the air like ritual
        dice. Each rotation re-tuned the frequency of existence. I felt myself
        stretched, rewoven across parallel pulses. This was no game. This was
        divination by entropy. Each loop bled into the next until the beginning
        was behind me, in front of me, and whispering through the soles of my
        feet.
